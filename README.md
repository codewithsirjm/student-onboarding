## 📅 Weekly Roadmap: From Core Foundations to Subject-Specific Deep Dives

This schedule is a general plan and **may evolve depending on our pace, needs, and the specific subject** you are enrolled in.

All classes, regardless of title, will cover the fundamentals of:

- Building your digital footprint
- Learning Git + GitHub
- Coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Deploying projects using GitHub Pages
- Practicing prompt engineering using Cursor AI

But beyond that, we will also **deep dive into the main subject** of your enrolled course (e.g. Web Server Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, System Integration and Architecture, etc.). Expect meaningful connections between your hands-on practice and your subject’s real-world application.

## 🧠 Note on Flexibility

This is just a **guiding plan**, not a rigid timeline. We will adjust based on:

- The speed of class comprehension
- The depth needed in the course subject
- Real-world discussions and challenges that may arise

The goal is not to finish everything — the goal is to **build something meaningful, learn deeply, and grow as future developers**.
